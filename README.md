Installation instruction:
- download zip
- run Blender and go to File -> User Preferences(or Ctrl+Alt+U)
- at the bottom of the window press "Install from File.." and locate and confirm downloaded zip file(addon will show up in the list of avalaible addons)
- check empty rectangle right next to the addon's name to enable it
- addon is installed, but let the window open...

Now, to have addon work properly we need also external tool called GDAL
- visit www.gisinternals.com/release.php
- choose 32/64 bit version, download "gdal-201-1800-x64-core.msi" and install it
- go to addon's preferences, in "External Tools" locate GDAL folder(by default installed to c:\Program Files\GDAL\)

Viola, tool's ready!!!
