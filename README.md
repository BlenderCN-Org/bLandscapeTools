[Wiki](https://github.com/paxetgloria/bLandscapeTools/wiki) available for further information.

**Prerequisites:**
- download **'bLandscapeTools-master.zip'** addon
- grab Blender from https://builder.blender.org/download/ (currently only Windows is supported) and unzipped it wherever you want
- get the external tool called GDAL from www.gisinternals.com/release.php, choose 32/64 bit version, download "gdal-xxx-1800-x64-core.msi"(xxx = whatever latest version there is) and install it(by default installed to c:\Program Files\GDAL


**Addon installation:**

*Note: if you unzipped Blender into a location which requires Administrator's rights to write, make sure to 'Run as administrator' when launching Blender, this is necessary only once when addon(more precisely OpenCV) is being installed for the first time*
- run Blender and go to File -> User Preferences(or Ctrl+Alt+U)
- switch to **Add-ons** tab and at the bottom of the window press "Install from File..", locate and confirm downloaded **bLandscapeTools-master.zip** file(addon will show up in the list of avalaible addons)
- check empty rectangle right next to the addon's name to enable it -> addon is installed!!!
- now, open addon's properties by clicking on the arrow right next to addon's name and in the **Preferences** set the **GDAL path**(by default installed to c:\Program Files\GDAL)
- before the last step I recommend to open system console, either go to **Window -> Toggle System Console** or  press **Space** and type **Toggle System Console** and hit **Enter**
- now get back to the addon's preferences and hit **Install OpenCV button**, in the console you should see the progress of downloading and installing OpenCV library
- once done please don't forget to press "Save User Settings" at the bottom of the window 

Viola, tool is ready to use!!!
