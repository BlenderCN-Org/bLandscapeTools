[Wiki](https://github.com/paxetgloria/bLandscapeTools/wiki) available for further information.

Prerequisites:
- download 'bLandscapeTools-master.zip' addon
- grab Blender from https://builder.blender.org/download/ (currently only Windows is supported)and unzipped it wherever you want.
- get the external tool called GDAL from www.gisinternals.com/release.php, choose 32/64 bit version, download "gdal-xxx-1800-x64-core.msi"(xxx = whatever latest version there is) and install it

Addon installation:
Note: if you unzipped Blender into a location which requires Administrator's rights to write, make sure to 'Run as administrator' when launching Blender, this is necessary only once when addon(more precisely OpenCV) is being installed for the first time
- download zip
- run Blender and go to File -> User Preferences(or Ctrl+Alt+U)
- at the bottom of the window press "Install from File.." and locate and confirm downloaded zip file(addon will show up in the list of avalaible addons)
- check empty rectangle right next to the addon's name to enable it
- addon is installed, but leave the window opened...

- choose 32/64 bit version, download "gdal-201-1800-x64-core.msi" and install it
- go to addon's preferences, in "External Tools" locate GDAL folder(by default installed to c:\Program Files\GDAL\)
- at the bottom of the window press "Save User Settings"

Viola, tool's ready!!!
